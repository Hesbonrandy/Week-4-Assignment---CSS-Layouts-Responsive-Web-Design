# Responsive Webpage with Flexbox & CSS Grid

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` — The main HTML file with semantic structure.
- `styles/styles.css` — The stylesheet using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Flexbox**: Used for the navigation menu and card layout (1D alignment).
- **CSS Grid**: Used in the main content area to create a two-column layout (sidebar + content).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to:
  - **Desktop** (≥769px): Full horizontal layout
  - **Tablet** (≤768px): Stacked sidebar and vertical navigation
  - **Mobile** (≤480px): Optimized spacing and full-width elements

## 🖼️ How It Works

- The layout uses relative units (`rem`, `fr`, `%`) and `gap` for consistent spacing.
- Media queries adjust the layout based on screen size.
- No external libraries or frameworks — pure HTML and CSS!
